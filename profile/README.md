# Ragastra  
### Engineering the Invisible Mobility Grid

Ragastra is a deep-tech mobility organization focused on building **MV-LEV (Magnetic Vehicle – Linear Electromagnetic Levitation)** — a modular electromagnetic suspension and wireless-powered mobility architecture designed for scalable, corridor-first deployment.

We are building not just vehicles, but a **system-level mobility upgrade**.

---

## 🚄 What We’re Building

MV-LEV is a subsurface electromagnetic mobility system that combines:

- **Electromagnetic Suspension (EMS)** for stable levitation  
- **Linear Synchronous Motor (LSM)** propulsion  
- **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)** for onboard energy delivery  
- **Modular guideway infrastructure** for phased deployment  

### The Objective

Deliver **maglev-grade performance** with dramatically lower capital and lifecycle cost than traditional commercial maglev systems — optimized for Indian and emerging-market deployment realities.

---

## ⚙️ Core Principles

### 1. Stability as Baseline  
Closed-loop electromagnetic suspension maintaining precise air-gap control under dynamic load conditions.

### 2. Power from the Ground  
Track-side delivered energy reduces onboard mass, eliminates dependency on large primary batteries, and simplifies lifecycle logistics.

### 3. Modular Corridor Deployment  
Phased installation model:
- Campus & airport pilots  
- Urban connectors  
- Intercity corridors  

Infrastructure scales without requiring full system replacement.

## 🧠 Engineering Focus Areas

- Electromagnetics (EMS force modeling & scaling)
- High-frequency Wireless Power Transfer
- Linear motor propulsion optimization
- Power electronics (SiC-based rectification & DC bus design)
- Thermal management
- Fault-tolerant control systems
- Digital twin simulation and integration

---

## 🔬 Current Technical Traction

- Stable electromagnetic levitation demonstrated (lab scale)
- 100W wireless power transfer prototype validated
- Closed-loop PID levitation control implemented
- Multi-subsystem modeling completed (CAD + simulations)
- Integrated system architecture defined

These milestones validate the core physics and control stability required for scale-up.

---

## 📊 Deployment Philosophy

We do not attempt full-system disruption.

Instead:
- Upgrade corridors.
- Reduce mechanical wear.
- Improve energy efficiency.
- Preserve public-infrastructure compatibility.
- Align with PPP and state-backed deployment models.

## 💰 Economic Design Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CAPEX | ~₹75 Cr/km (single-direction guideway) |
| OPEX | 35–45% lower than metro benchmarks |
| Energy Use | 30–40% lower per train-km vs metro |
| Availability | 99%+ infrastructure-grade uptime |
| IRR | 11–15% under concession models |

Infrastructure-grade economics.  
Maglev-grade performance.  
Modular scalability.

## 🛡️ System Resilience Philosophy

The system is designed around:

- Redundancy  
- Fault isolation  
- Sectionalized power architecture  
- Adaptive tuning  
- Predictive maintenance  

Failure is treated as a design constraint — not an afterthought.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To make high-performance electromagnetic mobility:

- Deployable  
- Affordable  
- Scalable  
- Sustainable  

Distance should not be a burden.

---

## 🚀 Status

Pre-revenue.  
Prototype phase.  
Focused on physical validation, subsystem integration, and pilot-readiness roadmap.

---

## 📌 Vision

Ragastra aims to become a foundational infrastructure technology provider for next-generation electromagnetic mobility systems — built for real-world constraints, not showcase corridors.
