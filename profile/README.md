# Ragastra  
### Systems. Not Ideas.

Ragastra is an engineering-focused research and build group working on high-impact, hardware-heavy, real-world systems.

We design, simulate, prototype, and validate complex electromechanical and infrastructure-grade technologies, starting from first principles.

We are not a pitch deck.
We are a build-first organization.

## What We Do

Ragastra works on multi-domain engineering systems including:

- Advanced mobility architectures
- Electromagnetic systems
- Wireless power systems
- Control systems & real-time feedback loops
- Power electronics
- Infrastructure-scale deployment models
- System integration & digital twins

Each project is treated as a **full-stack system**, not just a component.

## Our Approach

We follow a strict engineering philosophy:

1. Start from physics.
2. Model before building.
3. Build before scaling.
4. Design for failure tolerance.
5. Integrate subsystems into one coherent architecture.

Every project must survive simulation, lab validation, and economic scrutiny.

## Current Projects

### MV-LEV  
A modular electromagnetic mobility architecture combining levitation, propulsion, and distributed power delivery.

### Additional Research Tracks
- Wireless Power Transfer scaling
- High-efficiency power electronics architectures
- Electromagnet design optimization
- Fault-tolerant infrastructure modeling
- System-level FMEA and resilience design

(Projects evolve as research progresses.)

## What Makes Ragastra Different

- We work on infrastructure-grade problems.
- We combine hardware, software, and economics.
- We simulate deeply before fabrication.
- We design with scalability in mind from day one.
- We document rigorously.

No buzzwords.
No surface-level innovation.
Only system thinking.

## Stage

Early-stage engineering organization.  
Lab-scale validation underway.  
Focused on prototype-to-pilot transition roadmap.

---

## Long-Term Vision

To build deployable, scalable engineering systems that solve large, structural problems, not incremental features.

Ragastra exists to build things that are difficult.

And make them work.
